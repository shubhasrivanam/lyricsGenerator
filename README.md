# lyricsGenerator
This is a python program that allows you to generate lyrics using musixmatch api. I have first imported musixmatch library into my python application and by using the built-in functions of musixmatch library I was able to access their song lyrics. I just wanted to get a head start with working with an api. It was a fun project, it did really improve my knowledge on apis a lot.

This project can also be done by importing json and working with requests library of python as well.
